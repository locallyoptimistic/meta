# Messaging - Intro to Author Channel:

:wave: We're excited to work with you on the post. Here is an overview of the process:
1. Review our [licensing policies](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/licensing/) and ensure you’re comfortable with them. 
2. Create a shared Google doc and ask for a review in your author channel (with the link).
- You can share an outline if you want early, more structural feedback, or you can share a more finished post if you prefer. 
- You'll get feedback from 2-3 folks in this channel within one week, or communication on a timeline if it will take longer than that. 
- We *will* give critical feedback on your post — but our goal is for you to publish something of super high quality that will be a long term reference for our community. All feedback will be constructive. 
- If there's anyone else you'd like to review, feel free to invite them to this channel so all of your edit convos are happening in one place. We may also propose additional reviewers depending on the content, but will ask you before we add them here. 
3.  Once your post is ready for publication, we will mutually determine a publish date and will walk you through the process of requesting a custom illustration for the post.
4.  We will invite you to WordPress as a contributor, where you will create and schedule the final version of your post.



# Messaging - Ready to Publish:

Congrats - we're getting close! I'll invite you to WordPress momentarily; let me know if you don't see an invite in your email. 
Before you post, you'll need to:
In Slack:
- Request an illustration in #illustrations! @Margarita is our awesome illustrator, and she should be able to turn around a new one in a week or so, though it very much depends on her schedule. You can look back at other threads to see how folks approach this - you can be very specific, or more open-ended in what you are looking for.
In WP:
- Update your profile. Make sure you at least have a photo and bio, but also feel free to add social links, update your preferred names, etc.
- Create your post (posts >> add new), paste in your post test, preview, make sure all is well.
- Add your illustration to your post.
- Schedule your post to go live!
In Slack:
- When the post goes live, announce it in #announcements!
If you have any issues, want a set of :eyes:s to review, whatever, let us know!
